Course: Database development with PL/SQL

## 1. Overview of Tasks

This exercise explored Oracle’s database architecture, emphasizing the creation, configuration, and management of pluggable databases. The first task involved establishing a personalized PDB to host all coursework data, while the second demonstrated lifecycle management through the creation and deletion of a temporary Pluggable Database. The final task focused on configuring Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) to monitor and verify database operations, reinforcing both theoretical understanding and administrative skills.

## 2. Task 1 – Creating a New Pluggable Database

This step created a new pluggable database named li_pdb_28410 with an admin user account liesse_plsqlauca_28410.

The database was then opened and saved in a state that will automatically open after restart.

## 3. Task 2 – Creating and Deleting a Pluggable Database

A temporary PDB was created to demonstrate how to remove a database when no longer needed.

After verifying its creation, it was closed and dropped along with its data files.

## 4. Task 3 – Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) Configuration

### Steps Performed:

Started the Oracle Database Express service:

## Conclusion

This practical showcased how a single container can host multiple, self-contained worlds through Oracle’s pluggable database architecture.
By creating, managing, and monitoring PDBs, I gained hands-on mastery of database flexibility and control.
It proved that true database administration is not just about commands—but about building and managing living systems of data.
